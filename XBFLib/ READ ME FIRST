/************************************************************************************ This is a simple example of how to create a shared library and an application* that calls the a routine in the shared library.* * The application depends on the MSL RuntimePPC.DLL which is also a shared library.  * In order for the this example to run, you will need to build the "callling app" * target and copy the file "MSL RuntimePPC.DLL" from ":Metrowerks CodeWarrior:MacOS * Support:Libraries:Runtime:Runtime PPC:" to this example folder.  You may have to * build MSL RuntimePPC.DLL if it does not already exist in the "Runtime PPC" folder.  * * Once you have run the example, try using the "Merge Into Output" option in the * Attributes pane in the Project Inspector window to merge the MSL RuntimePPC.DLL * into the "calling app" target.  After this adjustment, you can discard the copy * of MSL RuntimePPC.DLL located in this example folder.  This demostrates the * functionality of the "Merge Into Output" option.* * For more information, see the chapter on creating Shared Library projects and * the chapter on MacOS Support Files in our "Targeting Mac OS" manual.** 08/27/98* Patrick Sullivan (thanks to Lucien Stavenhagen for the seeds of this example)**  © 1997-1998 Metrowerks Corp.**  Questions and comments to:*       <mailto:support@metrowerks.com>*       <http://www.metrowerks.com/>* ***********************************************************************************/
